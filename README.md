# nirc
Fork of nirc (https://github.com/cjstewart88/nirc) which is a simple web browser IRC client written in Node.js. This fork adapts the client specifically for use with AI-Commune by specifying a new theme and then auto-connecting.

```

- Install dependencies using npm:

```

- Build the application:
